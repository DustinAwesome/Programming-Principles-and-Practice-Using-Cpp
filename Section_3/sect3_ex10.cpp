Section 3 exercise 10.
a program that takes an operation followed by two operands and outputs the result. For example:
+ 100 3.14
* 4 5
Read the operation into a string called operation and use an if-statement to figure out which 
operation the user wants, for example, if (operation=="+"). Read the operands into variables 
of type double. Implement this for operations called +, â€“, *, /, plus, minus, mul, and div 
with their obvious meanings.
